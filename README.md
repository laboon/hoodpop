To run:

ruby hood_pop.rb <ruby file> 

This will output to the screen the following data:
     1. Tokens in the file
     2. Parsing results of the file
     3. Bytecode after compilation

I recommend you pipe this to a file (add "> file.txt" to the end of the ruby command above), as it's quite a bit for one screen.
