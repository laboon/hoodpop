To run:

ruby hood_pop.rb ruby_file 

This will output to the screen the following data:
     1. Tokens in the file<p>
     2. Parsing results of the file (an abstract syntax tree)<p>
     3. Bytecode after compilation<p>

I recommend you pipe this to a file (add "> file.txt" to the end of the ruby command above), as it's quite a bit for one screen.
